- [ ] Create `weekly_insights` table for storing AI-generated insights
- [ ] Create `ai_analysis_history` table for tracking AI prompts and responses
- [ ] Add database indexes for performance optimization
- [ ] Run database migrations locally

## Phase 3: Backend API Development
- [ ] Create `POST /api/coach/profile` endpoint for profile creation
- [ ] Create `GET /api/coach/profile` endpoint for profile retrieval
- [ ] Create `PUT /api/coach/profile` endpoint for profile updates
- [ ] Create `GET /api/coach/insights` endpoint for weekly insights
- [ ] Create `POST /api/coach/insights/generate` endpoint for AI analysis
