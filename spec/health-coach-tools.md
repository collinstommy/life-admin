# Nutrition Coach AI Tools - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

This PRD outlines the core AI tools needed to transform the existing health tracking app into an intelligent nutrition coaching system. These tools will enable users to have natural conversations about their health data while ensuring reliable, accurate responses.

## Problem Statement

Currently, users can log health data but lack actionable insights. Manual analysis of patterns across sleep, nutrition, workouts, and mood is time-consuming and error-prone. Users need an AI coach that can analyze their data and provide personalized recommendations.

## Core Tools Specification

### 1. Health Summary Tool
**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive health overview for any time period
**Usage**: "How am I doing this week?" or "Give me a monthly health summary"

```typescript
getHealthSummary(timeframe: 'today' | 'week' | 'month' | 'quarter' | 'year', metrics?: string[])
// Returns: energy trends, mood patterns, workout frequency, nutrition quality
```

**Timeframe Values**:
- `'today'` - Current day only
- `'week'` - Last 7 days  
- `'month'` - Last 30 days
- `'quarter'` - Last 90 days
- `'year'` - Last 365 days

### 2. Nutrition Pattern Analysis Tool  
**Purpose**: Analyze dietary patterns and identify nutrition gaps
**Usage**: "How's my protein intake?" or "What's missing from my diet?"

```typescript
analyzeNutritionPatterns(days: number, focus?: 'protein' | 'variety' | 'timing')
// Returns: ingredient frequency, meal timing, nutrition gaps, recipe suggestions
```

### 3. Performance Correlation Tool
**Purpose**: Find connections between different health metrics
**Usage**: "Does my sleep affect my workouts?" or "What impacts my energy levels?"

```typescript
findHealthCorrelations(metric1: string, metric2: string, timeframe: string)
// Returns: correlation strength, patterns, specific examples, recommendations
```

### 4. Recipe Optimization Tool
**Purpose**: Suggest recipe improvements and meal swaps
**Usage**: "Which meals should I change?" or "How can I improve my dinner recipes?"

```typescript
optimizeRecipes(nutritionGoal: string, currentMeals: string[], timeframe: string)
// Returns: recipe swaps, ingredient additions, meal timing suggestions
```

### 5. Trend Analysis Tool
**Purpose**: Identify patterns and changes over time across all health metrics
**Usage**: "What are my trends this month?" or "How has my fitness improved?"

```typescript
analyzeTrends(timeframe: string, includeForecasting?: boolean)
// Returns: metric trends, improvement areas, decline warnings, future projections
```

## Tool Architecture

```typescript
// Core tool interface
interface HealthTool {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  parameters: z.ZodSchema;
  execute: (params: any, ctx: AppContext) => Promise<any>;
}

// Example implementation
const healthSummaryTool: HealthTool = {
  name: 'getHealthSummary',
  description: 'Get comprehensive health overview for specified timeframe',
  parameters: z.object({
    timeframe: z.enum(['week', 'month', 'quarter']),
    includeComparisons: z.boolean().default(true)
  }),
  execute: async ({ timeframe, includeComparisons }, ctx) => {
    // Implementation details...
  }
};
```

## Key Benefits

### Reliability Benefits

**Consistent Data Processing**: Tools ensure standardized calculations across all user interactions. Sleep quality scores, workout intensity ratings, and nutrition assessments use identical logic every time.

**Error Handling**: Database connection failures, missing data periods, and invalid date ranges are handled gracefully with meaningful fallbacks rather than AI hallucination.

**Data Integrity**: Tools validate all metrics against known ranges (sleep hours 0-12, mood ratings 1-10) and flag anomalies for user review.

**Accurate Calculations**: Complex statistical analyses (correlations, trend lines, percentile rankings) are computed using verified algorithms rather than AI approximation.

### Performance Benefits

**Selective Data Loading**: Tools fetch only relevant data subsets. Weekly summaries load 7 days of data, not entire user history, reducing database load by ~90%.

**Parallel Processing**: Multiple tools can execute simultaneously. User asking "How am I doing overall?" triggers nutrition, sleep, and workout tools concurrently.

**Intelligent Caching**: Expensive correlation analyses are cached for 24-48 hours. Subsequent similar queries return instant results without database processing.

**Adaptive Cache Strategy**: Uses hybrid caching based on data currency - historical periods cached permanently, current periods cached for hours to ensure fresh insights.

**Progressive Detail**: Initial responses use lightweight summary tools. Follow-up questions trigger more detailed analysis tools only when needed.

## Caching Strategy

### Hybrid Timeframe Caching
All tools implement intelligent caching based on data currency:

```typescript
const getCacheStrategy = (timeframe: string) => {
  const { startDate, endDate } = getDateRange(timeframe);
  const isHistorical = endDate < startOfToday();
  
  if (isHistorical) {
    // Historical data - cache permanently (data won't change)
    return {
      key: `tool-result-${toolName}-${startDate}-${endDate}`,
      ttl: null // permanent
    };
  } else {
    // Current period - cache for hours (new data coming in)
    return {
      key: `tool-result-${toolName}-${timeframe}-${currentDate}`,
      ttl: 4 * 60 * 60 // 4 hours
    };
  }
};
```

## Caching Strategy

### Storage: Cloudflare KV
Tool results cached in KV for global edge distribution and native TTL support.

```typescript
// Cache implementation
const cacheKey = `tool-${toolName}-${hashParams(params)}-${dateRange}`;
await env.HEALTH_CACHE.put(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(result), {
  expirationTtl: isHistorical ? null : (4 * 60 * 60) // 4 hours for current periods
});
```

### Cache Behavior Examples
- **Monday**: "How's my month?" → Generates summary, caches for 4 hours
- **Monday (3 hours later)**: "How's my month?" → Returns cached version  
- **Tuesday**: "How's my month?" → New cache key, generates fresh summary
- **Next month**: "How was December?" → Permanent cache, instant response

### Cache Invalidation
- Historical periods (completed months/weeks): Never invalidated
- Current periods: Expire after 4 hours to ensure fresh data
- Tool results cached independently to maximize reuse across different conversations

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Analytics (Week 1-2)
- Health Summary Tool
- Nutrition Pattern Analysis Tool  
- Basic trend identification

### Phase 2: Advanced Insights (Week 3-4)
- Performance Correlation Tool
- Recipe Optimization Tool
- Caching layer implementation

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 5-6)
- Tool result caching
- Parallel tool execution
- Response optimization

## Success Metrics

**User Engagement**: Increase in chat interactions per week (target: 5x current usage)
**Response Quality**: User satisfaction ratings on AI recommendations (target: >85%)
**Performance**: Average response time under 3 seconds for complex analyses
**Reliability**: Tool failure rate below 2% across all operations

## Technical Considerations

**Database Performance**: Tools will require indexed queries on date ranges and metric types
**AI Token Usage**: Expected 60-80% reduction in tokens per conversation through targeted data retrieval  
**Caching Strategy**: Cloudflare KV for tool result caching with native TTL support, D1 for structured health data storage.
**Rate Limiting**: Tool execution limits to prevent abuse and manage computational costs
