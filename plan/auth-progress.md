Here's a summary of our conversation:

**Project Context:**
We are working on the `life-admin` project, specifically modifying authentication for routes defined in `src/server.tsx`.

**What We've Done:**

1.  **Initial Authentication Change:**
    *   Identified the existing API key authentication in `src/server.tsx` (using `X-API-Key` header).
    *   Implemented a basic password authentication middleware (`authenticateBasicPassword`) in `src/server.tsx` to secure `/api/*` routes.
    *   Kept the original `authenticateApiKey` middleware for the `/logs` route.
    *   Added a password input field and a "Save Password" button to the UI in `/home/tom/toms_code/life-admin/assets/static/index.html`.
    *   Implemented client-side logic in `/home/tom/toms_code/life-admin/assets/static/js/app.js` to read the password from the input, store it in a standard (non-HTTP-only) cookie, and include it as an `X-Password` header in API requests.

2.  **Transition to JWT Authentication (Improved Security):**
    *   Recognized the security risks of storing the password directly in a client-accessible cookie.
    *   Decided to switch to JWT authentication using Hono's built-in JWT functionality and HTTP-only cookies.
    *   **Server-Side (`/home/tom/toms_code/life-admin/src/server.tsx`):**
        *   Imported `sign`, `verify` from `hono/jwt` and `getCookie`, `setCookie` from `hono/cookie`.
        *   Introduced a `jwtSecret` (needs to be replaced with a strong environment variable).
        *   Created an `authenticateJwt` middleware to verify tokens from the `jwt` HTTP-only cookie.
        *   Replaced `authenticateBasicPassword` with `authenticateJwt` for `/api/*` routes.
        *   Added a new `/api/login` endpoint to handle password submission, sign a JWT, and set it as an HTTP-only cookie.
    *   **Client-Side (`/home/tom/toms_code/life-admin/assets/static/index.html` and `assets/static/js/app.js`):**
        *   Changed the "Save Password" button to a "Login" button in `index.html`.
        *   Modified `app.js` to remove the client-side cookie storage and `X-Password` header logic.
        *   Implemented a `handleLogin` function in `app.js` that sends the password to the new `/api/login` endpoint. Subsequent API calls to `/api/*` now implicitly use the JWT sent back in the HTTP-only cookie by the server.

**Files Modified:**

*   `/home/tom/toms_code/life-admin/src/server.tsx`
*   `/home/tom/toms_code/life-admin/assets/static/index.html`
*   `/home/tom/toms_code/life-admin/assets/static/js/app.js`

**What Needs To Be Done Next:**

1.  **Environment Setup:** Ensure the `PASSWORD` and `jwtSecret` environment variables are correctly set for the server.
2.  **Rebuild:** Rebuild the application (e.g., `npm run build` or `yarn build`) to apply the changes.
3.  **Testing:**
    *   Run the application.
    *   In the browser, enter the password and click the "Login" button. Confirm successful login.
    *   Verify that "Voice Record" and "Text Input" features (which use `/api/*` routes) function correctly, leveraging the JWT in the HTTP-only cookie.
    *   Confirm that the "History" tab (which uses the `/logs` route) still functions with the original API key authentication.
