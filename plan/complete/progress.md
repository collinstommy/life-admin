- ✅ Optimized the audio data handling for Whisper API using Uint8Array conversion
- ✅ Set up Gemini API for extracting structured health data from transcripts

### Backend Infrastructure
- ✅ Set up Cloudflare Worker with Hono.js framework
- ✅ Configured R2 storage for audio file management
- ✅ Defined database schema with Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Created API endpoints for health log upload, retrieval, and audio recording access
- ✅ Implemented legacy Notion API integration with caching
- ✅ Added transcript data to API responses

### Frontend Development
- ✅ Enhanced UI to display both raw transcript and structured JSON output
- ✅ Implemented real API integration for the client-side recorder

### Data Models

- ⏳ Implement proper error handling and validation

## Next Steps

1. Complete the database integration to replace mock data
2. Develop the frontend UI for health log recording and viewing
3. Implement user authentication and security measures
4. Add data visualization for health trends
5. Deploy the application to production
