# Health Tracking Voice Recording Application: Technical Implementation Plan

## High-Level Vision
Create a streamlined health tracking application that allows users to record voice logs of their daily health activities. The application will:
1. Capture voice recordings via a web interface
2. Process speech to text using AI transcription
3. Extract structured health data from the transcripts
4. Store both raw recordings and structured data
5. Provide an interface for reviewing and analyzing health trends over time

This tool serves as a personal health journal with minimal friction, transforming casual spoken reflections into structured data that can be analyzed by AI assistants.

## Architecture

### System Components
1. **Frontend Web Application**
   - Web application with recording interface
   - Displays raw transcript
   - Displays structured data
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop use
   - shows entires for each day

2. **Backend API**
   - RESTful endpoints for recordings, transcripts, and structured data
   - API that lists an array of health logs - lists the date and health data

3. **Storage**
   - Object storage for audio recordings
   - Database for structured health data and metadata

4. **AI Processing Pipeline**
   - Speech-to-text transcription service
   - Large language model for structured data extraction

### Data Flow
1. User records health log through web interface
2. Audio file is sent to backend API
3. Backend stores raw audio in object storage
4. Audio is processed for transcription
5. Transcript is analyzed to extract structured data - this should be done by AI
6. Structured data is stored in database
7. User receives confirmation and structured data view

## Data Structure Concepts

### Health Log Data
- Unique identifier for each log
- Recording date
- Link to audio recording
- Transcript text
- Creation and modification timestamps

### Structured Health Data Categories
- Screen time tracking
- Water intake measurements
- Sleep duration and quality
- Energy and mood ratings
- Weight tracking
- Activities and notes

### Related Data Categories
- Workout sessions (type, duration, intensity)
- Meals and nutrition
- Pain and discomfort tracking

## API Functionality

### Core Operations
- Upload new audio recordings
- Retrieve health logs with filtering options
- Access specific health log details
- Update health log data manually
- Remove health logs when needed

## Sample Structured Data

Below is a sample of the structured data format that will be generated from voice recordings:

```json
{
  "date": "2023-07-15",
  "screenTimeHours": 4.5,
  "workouts": [
    {
      "type": "Morning Yoga",
      "durationMinutes": 40,
      "intensity": 6,
      "notes": "Focused on stretching and breathing"
    },
    {
      "type": "Evening Walk",
      "durationMinutes": 45,
      "distanceKm": 3.2,
      "intensity": 4,
      "notes": "Pleasant walk around the neighborhood"
    }
  ],
  "meals": [
    {
      "type": "Breakfast",
      "notes": "Overnight oats with blueberries and a tablespoon of almond butter"
    },
    {
      "type": "Lunch",
      "notes": "Quinoa salad with chickpeas, cucumber, tomatoes and olive oil dressing"
    },
    {
      "type": "Dinner",
      "notes": "Baked salmon with sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli"
    },
    {
      "type": "Snacks",
      "notes": "Apple and a handful of mixed nuts"
    },
    {
      "type": "Coffee",
      "notes": "Two cups in the morning"
    }
  ],
  "waterIntakeLiters": 2.8,
  "painDiscomfort": {
    "location": "Lower back",
    "intensity": 3,
    "notes": "Mild discomfort after sitting for long periods"
  },
  "sleep": {
    "hours": 7.5,
    "quality": 8
  },
  "energyLevel": 7,
  "mood": {
    "rating": 8,
    "notes": "Feeling productive and generally positive today"
  },
  "weightKg": 68.5,
  "otherActivities": "30 minutes of meditation and reading for an hour before bed",
  "notes": "Overall a good day. Need to remember to take short breaks when working at the computer."
}
```

This structured data is extracted from voice recordings using AI processing and can be used to track health patterns over time.
